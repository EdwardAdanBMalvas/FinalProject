			<h2>Collaborations<h2>
			<p>With modern technology, collaboration across the globe has become much easier. We can see this through GitHub, where programmers can work together anywhere in the world. This also gave way to Messenger and other platforms where the exchanging of ideas became much easier.</p>
			<h2>Access to Information<h2>
			<p>The internet made it very easy for new knowledge to be spread to anyone. For example, YouTube, where tutorials and lessons can be seen about almost everything, from solving math problems to even fixing motorcycles. The rise of the internet gave way to easy access to information and, thus more ideas.</p>
			<h2>Automation<h2>
			<p>Modern technology has allowed automation to rise. Automation can lead to the motivation of inventions. For example, Amazonâ€™s use of robots to automate the process of moving products in warehouses. </p>
